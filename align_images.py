class AlignImages:
    '''
    This class is meant to be inherited by a KlipRetrieve() or PreInjectImages()
    class instance, not used individually.

    Takes in data cubes from a directory of images and brings the bright points
    of the reference and target images as close to true alignment as possible.
    (It's not an exact removal, instead approximating these shifts at the size
    of a NirSpec IFU pixel -- .1 arcseconds.) The more aligned the two sets of
    images are, the better the results of PSF subtraction will be later on.

    There are three steps -- removing the dither offsets
    (self._shift_dither_pos()), removing offsets due to overall pointing error
    (self._shift_overall_ptg()), and finally, shifting the reference images if
    the previous two steps centered them on a different pixel than the science
    images (self._align_brights()). (Dither pointing error is not considered
    since it's so small compared to the NirSpec IFU's pixel scale.)

    The end product is self.stackable_cubes, which is used by KlipRetrieve()
    for PSF subtraction.

    self.plot_shifts() helps visualize the progression of these alignment
    procedures by plotting the first and last steps.

        Removes shifts in images due to dither cycle in both the reference and
        science sets of images. Then, makes sure both sets are centered over
        the same pixel.

        Argument `align_style` controls which method is used for alignment --
        'theoretical' (default) removes overall pointing error and aligns
        bright pixels afterward, while 'empirical1' and 'empirical2' skip
        directly to bright pixel alignment.

        'empirical1' aligns based on the mean brightest pixel in each data cube
        -- even if particular slices have a bright pixel that's slightly
        off-line. 'empirical2' chooses a target position the bright pixel and
        shifts all slices of all data cubes to match it.

        I believe that 'empirical2' should lead to better results than
        'empirical1' since there won't be any off-line stragglers. The
        comparison with 'theoretical' will be interesting to see.
